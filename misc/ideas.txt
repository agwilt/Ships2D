coordinates:
 - save the camera's world coords (in meters?), and zoom (top-left of field)
 - disregard ships too far away from camera, go through and render close ones      (--> two "modes" for ships? accurate and just a point on a map)

-> convert between world coords and screen coords




Turret position variables:
 - base angle, max left, max right: relative to ship (0Â° is forwards)
 - angle: turrent angle relative to base
 - parent: pointer(?) to parent ship, to determine total world angle --> just hand over parent ship on creation
 - zoom, camera angle --> update with call to Group of objects




Actor class: has angle, position, velocity, "rudder", etc.
SubActor class: angle, position relative to parent Actor
